# Seam Carving Algorithm Implementation

## Description

This is a course project of [ECS174 Computer Vision](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/ecs-174-introduction-to-computer-vision/) [1], taught by Prof. Yong Jae Lee at University of California, Davis. In this project, we have implemented the good-old seam carving algorithm based on the [paper](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2013_fall/hw/proj3-seamcarving/imret.pdf) wrote by Avidan and Shamir [2] in MATLAB.
